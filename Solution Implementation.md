### Solution Implementation

**Title**: **Implementation of the Waste Detection Web Application**

**Steps**:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - **Source**: Gathered a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data) containing images of various waste types.
   - **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and labeled images to prepare them for model training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - **Platform**: Used Azure Custom Vision to create an object detection model.
   - **Training**: Uploaded and tagged images, then trained the model to accurately classify waste.

3. **Web Application Development**:
   - **Frontend**: Built with Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use interface for waste classification.
   - **Backend**: Integrated the Azure Custom Vision model to process images and return classification results in real-time.

4. **Deployment**:
   - **Hosting**: Deployed the application on a cloud platform, ensuring it is accessible and scalable.
   - **API Integration**: Utilized Azure APIs to connect the web app with the trained model for seamless operation.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - Included educational content on waste management and a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement.
