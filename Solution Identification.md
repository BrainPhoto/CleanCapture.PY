### Solution Identification

**Title**: **Waste Detection and Classification app**

**Overview**:
To tackle the challenges of waste management, I developed a web application that automatically detects and classifies waste as organic, recyclable, or non-recyclable. This solution uses Azure Custom Vision and a Kaggle dataset to create a precise and efficient waste classification system, which can be used for both images and live video.

**Key Features**:
- **Object Detection**: The application identifies and locates different types of waste within images, ensuring accurate classification.
- **Cloud Integration**: Using Azure Custom Vision, the model is trained and deployed in the cloud, enabling scalable and reliable performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web app provides a simple platform for users to upload images or capture live video for instant waste classification.
- **Environmental Impact**: The tool helps reduce landfill waste by promoting proper recycling and disposal practices.
