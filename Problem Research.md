### Problem Statement

**Title**: **Global Waste Management Challenges**

**Introduction**:
Waste management is a significant challenge globally, where a substantial portion of waste ends up in landfills. This improper disposal leads to various environmental and health issues that urgently need addressing. Traditional waste management practices are often inadequate, leading to inefficiencies and widespread environmental damage.

**Key Issues**:
1. **Increase in Landfills**:
   - The continuous accumulation of waste in landfills takes up valuable land space and poses long-term environmental risks.

2. **Eutrophication**:
   - The runoff from landfills can cause nutrient pollution in water bodies, leading to eutrophication and damaging aquatic ecosystems.

3. **Consumption of Toxic Waste by Animals**:
   - Animals often consume waste from landfills, leading to bioaccumulation of toxins in the food chain, which can have severe health consequences for both wildlife and humans.

4. **Leachate**:
   - The liquid that drains from landfills, known as leachate, can seep into the soil and contaminate groundwater, posing a threat to drinking water sources.

5. **Increase in Toxins**:
   - Improper waste disposal results in the release of hazardous substances into the environment, increasing toxin levels in the soil, water, and air.

6. **Land, Water, and Air Pollution**:
   - The accumulation of waste contributes to pollution across all environmental media, exacerbating climate change and harming biodiversity.

**Purpose**:
Given these challenges, it is crucial to implement a more effective waste management solution that can accurately identify and classify different types of waste, particularly recyclable materials. This approach will help mitigate the negative environmental impacts and promote sustainable waste management practices.
